Exponential-ish backoff for your notes!

`ancli` (Anki + CLI) is a CLI tool to make spaced repetition of your notes easy as easy as `ancli test`.

## Install

## What is ancli?

`ancli` is a CLI tool that attempts to reduce friction for users wanting to used space repetition to better remember their notes. `ancli` scrapes a user-defined directory, likely a notes directory, looking for regex matches on a decks configured symbol. Notes are then quizzed on an interval decided by the configured algorithm for the deck.

Features Include:
  - multiple decks
  - support multiple spaced repetition algorithms, including [SM2](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/english/ol/sm2)
  - saving deck progress to file system
